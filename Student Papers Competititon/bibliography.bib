	abstract = {Due to object detection's close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.},

However, they offer little transparency into their inner workings and are often treated as black boxes that deliver excellent performance. In this paper, we aim at alleviating this opaqueness of {CNNs} by providing visual explanations for the network's predictions. Our approach can analyze a variety of {CNN}-based models trained for computer vision applications, such as object recognition and caption generation. Unlike the existing methods, we achieve this via unraveling the forward pass operation. The proposed method exploits feature dependencies across the layer hierarchy and uncovers the discriminative image locations that guide the network's predictions. We name these locations {CNN} fixations, loosely analogous to human eye fixations. Our approach is a generic method that requires no architectural changes, additional training, or gradient computation, and computes the important image locations ({CNN} fixations). We demonstrate through a variety of applications that our approach is able to localize the discriminative image locations across different network architectures, diverse vision tasks, and data modalities.},

	abstract = {Vision transformers have become popular as a possible substitute to convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) for a variety of computer vision applications. These transformers, with their ability to focus on global relationships in images, offer large learning capacity. However, they may suffer from limited generalization as they do not tend to model local correlation in images. Recently, in vision transformers hybridization of both the convolution operation and self-attention mechanism has emerged, to exploit both the local and global image representations. These hybrid vision transformers, also referred to as {CNN}-Transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable results in vision applications. Given the rapidly growing number of hybrid vision transformers, it has become necessary to provide a taxonomy and explanation of these hybrid architectures. This survey presents a taxonomy of the recent vision transformer architectures and more specifically that of the hybrid vision transformers. Additionally, the key features of these architectures such as the attention mechanisms, positional embeddings, multi-scale processing, and convolution are also discussed. In contrast to the previous survey papers that are primarily focused on individual vision transformer architectures or {CNNs}, this survey uniquely emphasizes the emerging trend of hybrid vision transformers. By showcasing the potential of hybrid vision transformers to deliver exceptional performance across a range of computer vision tasks, this survey sheds light on the future directions of this rapidly evolving architecture.},

	abstract = {Detecting text location and recognizing them from scene images remains one of the most challenging and enduring research problems in the field of computer vision. Over the past few decades, various researchers working hard to increase the accuracy of text recognition in scene images by considering several challenges. Because of this, there is a high need for commercial text recognizers for natural scenes. Conventional optical character recognition ({OCR}) demands clean backgrounds, crisp layouts, and neat text, which are frequently not met by natural scene images. A major challenge in scene text recognition is its orientation. There are various orientations like horizontal, vertical, diagonal and off-diagonal. Sometimes these orientations are in curved nature than straight. Another challenge is texts are embedded with un-uniform backgrounds and complicated environments. The extraction of such text is harrowing because of noisy backgrounds, diverse fonts, and text sizes. In this research, a comprehensive solution for detecting text using Faster {RCNN} and {EasyOCR} for text recognition is used to increase accuracy. The proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark datasets such as {ICDAR}13 and {ICDAR}15. F-score improves by 2.1 and 1.4\% for detection on {ICDAR}13 and 15 datasets, respectively. Also noticed that 1.8\% of improvement in recognition accuracy.},

	abstract = {Vehicle identification systems are vital components that enable many aspects of contemporary life, such as safety, trade, transit, and law enforcement. They improve community and individual well-being by increasing vehicle management, security, and transparency. These tasks entail locating and extracting license plates from images or video frames using computer vision and machine learning techniques, followed by recognizing the letters or digits on the plates. This paper proposes a new license plate detection and recognition method based on the deep learning {YOLO} v8 method, image processing techniques, and the {OCR} technique for text recognition. For this, the first step was the dataset creation, when gathering 270 images from the internet. Afterward, {CVAT} (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) was used to annotate the dataset, which is an open-source software platform made to make computer vision tasks easier to annotate and label images and videos. Subsequently, the newly released Yolo version, the Yolo v8, has been employed to detect the number plate area in the input image. Subsequently, after extracting the plate the k-means clustering algorithm, the thresholding techniques, and the opening morphological operation were used to enhance the image and make the characters in the license plate clearer before using {OCR}. The next step in this process is using the {OCR} technique to extract the characters. Eventually, a text file containing only the character reflecting the vehicle's country is generated. To ameliorate the efficiency of the proposed approach, several metrics were employed, namely precision, recall, F1-Score, and {CLA}. In addition, a comparison of the proposed method with existing techniques in the literature has been given. The suggested method obtained convincing results in both detection as well as recognition by obtaining an accuracy of 99\% in detection and 98\% in character recognition.},

In the detection stage, we adopt a cascade structure comprising of a fast region proposal network and a R-{CNN} network. The R-{CNN} network not only eliminates false alarms but also regresses corner positions for each detected plate. This allows us to estimate an afﬁne transformation matrix to rectify the extracted plates. In the recognition stage, we propose an innovative structure composed of parallel spatial transform networks and shared-weight recognizers. The system is trained and evaluated on a Chinese license plate dataset with over 18K images. Results show that our detector performs better than faster R-{CNN} ({VGG}) which is 1.5x slower in testing and 57x larger in model size. The recognizer is also signiﬁcantly better than existing solutions, reducing 57.5\% of the errors of a state-of-the-art character sequence encoding scheme.},

	abstract = {Automatic License Plate Recognition ({ALPR}) has been a frequent topic of research due to many practical applications. However, many of the current solutions are still not robust in real-world situations, commonly depending on many constraints. This paper presents a robust and efficient {ALPR} system based on the state-of-the-art {YOLO} object detector. The Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) are trained and fine-tuned for each {ALPR} stage so that they are robust under different conditions (e.g., variations in camera, lighting, and background). Specially for character segmentation and recognition, we design a two-stage approach employing simple data augmentation tricks such as inverted License Plates ({LPs}) and flipped characters. The resulting {ALPR} approach achieved impressive results in two datasets. First, in the {SSIG} dataset, composed of 2,000 frames from 101 vehicle videos, our system achieved a recognition rate of 93.53\% and 47 Frames Per Second ({FPS}), performing better than both Sighthound and {OpenALPR} commercial systems (89.80\% and 93.03\%, respectively) and considerably outperforming previous results (81.80\%). Second, targeting a more realistic scenario, we introduce a larger public dataset, called {UFPR}-{ALPR} dataset, designed to {ALPR}. This dataset contains 150 videos and 4,500 frames captured when both camera and vehicles are moving and also contains different types of vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses and trucks). In our proposed dataset, the trial versions of commercial systems achieved recognition rates below 70\%. On the other hand, our system performed better, with recognition rate of 78.33\% and 35 {FPS}.},

	abstract = {Deep learning softwares are designed using artificial neural networks for various applications by training and testing them with an appropriate dataset. The raw image samples available in the dataset may contain noisy and unclear information due to radiation, heat and poor lighting conditions. Therefore, the researchers are trying to filter and enhance such noisy images through preprocessing steps for providing a valid feature information to the neural network layers included in the deep learning software. However, there are certain claims that roam around the researchers such as an image may lose some useful information when it is not preprocessed with an appropriate filter or enhancement technique. Hence, the work reviews the efficacy of the methodologies that are designed with and without a preprocessing step. Also, the work summarizes the common reasons and statements highlighted by the researchers for using and avoiding the preprocessing steps on designing a deep learning approach. The study is conducted to provide a clarity toward the requirement and non-requirement of preprocessing step in a deep learning software.},

and machine learning communities with a standard dataset of images and annotation, and standard evaluation procedures. Organised
annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.

This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification
and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object
or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history
of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension.},
